Shao Kahn and Shang Tsung are obsessed with reigning over various realms (parallel universes) and the winners of Mortal Kombat competitions are granted supreme control over these worlds. The Earthrealm (Earth) is an unconscious participant in this competition and only a few select humans understand the consequences of losing Mortal Kombat and what it will mean to Earth. In a universe with powerful evil sorcerers, cyborgs, Gods and movie stars, this Mortal Kombat digital media series drives a cohesive understanding of what this Universe is all about.\r\n\r\nEpisode 4: \"Kitana & Mileena (Part 1)\"\r\nBeautiful, athletic, and trained as highly skilled assassins, Kitana and Mileena have grown up thinking that they are sisters. Shao Kahn, Emperor of the Outworld, has tricked Shang Tsung into becoming his servant for Mortal Kombat by making him clone Mileena as a Tarkatan clone of Kitana, out of Shao Kahn's fear that Kitana wouldn't love him enough if she ever found out the truth about her Mother and Father.\r\n\r\n Directed by Kevin Tancharoen\r\n\r\nWritten by Todd Helbing & Aaron Helbing\r\n\r\nProduced by Kevin Tancharoen, Lance Sloane, Tim Carter\r\n\r\n\r\nCAST\r\nShao Khan..............................................................ALEKS PAUNOVIC\r\nKitana.....................................................................SAMANTHA TJHIA\r\nMileena...................................................................JOLENE TRAN\r\nKing Jerrod.............................................................KIRBY MORROW\r\nQueen Sindel..........................................................BEATRICE ILG\r\nShang Tsung..........................................................JOHNSON PHAN\r\nNarrator..................................................................KARIN INGHAMMAR\r\nBaraka....................................................................FRASER AITCHESON\r\nEdenian Knight # 1..................................................AARON HUTCHINSON\r\nEdenian Woman.....................................................LANI GELERA\r\nEdenian # 1.............................................................COLIN DECKER\r\nEdenian # 2.............................................................ELI ZAGOUDAKIS\r\nTarkatan Warrior........................................................DON LEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThis original live-action new media series is produced by Warner Bros.

A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\r\n\r\n\"As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not --- and never will be --- at war with Islam. I've made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.\"","tags":["Obama","Osama bin Laden","9/11","Afghanistan","Pakistan"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-N3dJvhgPg/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m-N3dJvhgPg/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dm-N3dJvhgPg&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player","mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v\u003dm-N3dJvhgPg"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/m-N3dJvhgPg?f\u003dstandard&app\u003dyoutube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v7.cache2.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwn4gOGbdHfjmxMYDSANFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v6.cache5.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwn4gOGbdHfjmxMYESARFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":586,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","recorded":"2011-05-01","location":"White House, Washington, DC","rating":4.29326,"likeCount":"6890","ratingCount":8368,"viewCount":1993990,"favoriteCount":3111,"commentCount":21035,"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"q8A5U9UdScs","uploaded":"2011-05-02T19:48:30.000Z","updated":"2011-05-03T23:19:08.000Z","uploader":"WHATTHEBUCKSHOW","category":"Travel","title":"OMG!

Lady Gaga tweet timing is a little off on promoting Judas and I do a dance to RuPaul's \"Superstar\" dedicated to our troops. I am reading many of the comments on my peron75 video and I know many of you are not wanting to \"celebrate\" a death. I respect your feelings and would never want to tell anyone how to react to something like this (I will tell you how to react to a Justin Bieber song or a Miley Cyrus movie! HA but not this).

I love. I slay...I am content.\"\r\n\r\n- Conan The Barbarian\r\n\r\nThe most legendary Barbarian of all time is back this Summer. Having thrived and evolved for eight consecutive decades in the public imagination- in prose and graphics, on the big screen and small, in games and properties of all kinds- Conan's exploits in the Hyborian Age now come alive like never before in a colossal 3D action-adventure film.\r\n\r\nmore...\r\n\r\nA quest that begins as a personal vendetta for the fierce Cimmerian warrior soon turns into an epic battle against hulking rivals, horrific monsters, and impossible odds, as Conan realizes he is the only hope of saving the great nations of Hyboria from an encroaching reign of supernatural evil.\r\nDeftly adapted from the original works of Robert E. Howard and faithful to the mythology and psychology of his iconic character, CONAN THE BARBARIAN stars Jason Momoa, Rachel Nichols, Stephen Lang, Rose McGowan, Saïd Taghmaoui and Ron Perlman. The film is directed by Marcus Nispel, and written by Thomas Dean Donnelly & Joshua Oppenheimer and Sean Hood.","tags":["lionsgate","conan","conanthebarbarian","barbarian"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3L7tRQzDEQ/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3L7tRQzDEQ/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dP3L7tRQzDEQ&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/P3L7tRQzDEQ?f\u003dstandard&app\u003dyoutube_gdata"},"duration":136,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":2.7106109,"likeCount":"133","ratingCount":311,"viewCount":650962,"favoriteCount":22,"commentCount":188,"status":{"value":"restricted","reason":"limitedSyndication"},"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","syndicate":"denied"}},{"id":"pN8E8L5c9WI","uploaded":"2011-05-06T01:34:43.000Z","updated":"2011-05-07T20:39:31.000Z","uploader":"WongFuProductions","category":"Entertainment","title":"Kung

aus unserer Sicht ist es die Bewunderung seiner Arbeit, man kann es sogar als ein Fan-Video sehen^^) Außerdem hat sich die Geschichte mit dem Alien ganz gut angeboten, da wir schon lange irgendwas mit einem Alien machen wollten xD (wie sich das anhört -

Slap me some skin! *high 5*\n\nThe weather is getting warmer and warmer by the day and it's just too hot to wear the hair down now (No thanks to humid frizzy hair getting stuck on our backs please).\n\nIn this tutorial, I demonstrate how to create 6 on-the-go hairstyles that will literally take you about a minute or two. They are not only quick & easy but also very comfortable for the sizzling weather. These hairstyles are very basic to do so they would be great for school/work.\n\nI'm asked so many times to do 'Bun' tutorials so hopefully this will be a helpful video. \n\nHope you guys are well. My family are visiting me in Hong Kong at the moment so spending lots of time with them. Also working on the new Bubzbeauty.com (which should be launched very soon) so working on lots of content for you guys. \n\nBubbi Brushes:\nSuper excited about them. They should be launched Summer 2011. \n\nThis instrumental is called 'My heart is beating' by K Will ^_~\n\nFor those who are wondering- I'm wearing a head scarf that I bought from my friend's cute online boutique.
