# ja.mesbrown.com Bootstrap

ja.mesbrown.com Bootstrap provides a starting point for new repositories for blog posts on my
http://ja.mesbrown.com blog.  The code is largely for my own use, but feel free to use it
in anyway you'd like.  If there's something I could improve, feel free to send a pull request.

## Quick start 

Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:ibjhb/ja.mesbrown.com-Bootstrap`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/ibjhb/ja.mesbrown.com-Bootstrap/zipball/master).

## Usage

Edit the files as necessary.  You'll probably want to check out the index.html

Versioning
----------

I will maintain versioning under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
